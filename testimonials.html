    <p><strong> Sample Testimony </strong> - I just wanted to share a quick note and let you know that you guys do a really good job. I’m glad I decided to work with you. It’s really great how easy your websites are to update and manage. I never have any problem at all.

        My new site is so much faster and easier to work with than my old site. It used to take me an hour or more to update a page and I would still sometimes screw things up.

        Now it’s almost like having a designer right here with me. I just choose the page, make the change and click save. It’s so simple.

        Thanks, guys!

<section id="Testimonials2">
    <p><strong> Headshots </strong> - All testimonials are good and if all else fails, a text only testimonial is better than no testimonial. But 65% of the population are visual learners and testimonials that include a photo are much more authentic. If you can’t persuade your client to provide a headshot, video, or candid photo (see below) you may be able to persuade them to allow you to use their company logo alongside their testimonial instead.
